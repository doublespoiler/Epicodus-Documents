## Journal 1 2022/08/03

>- Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing multiple months of technical trainings?
>- Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?

I decided to attend Epicodus because I always wanted to program. When I first enrolled at NAU, my major was Computer Science. However, I did a summer program before I started, and during that program I fell in love with literary analysis, particularly with video games and their visual design, so I decided to switch my major to Graphic Design. Turns out, I'm terrible at art and design, and struggled for two years. I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I changed my major back to Computer Science. However, University CS courses require math, and though I was always good at math, I hadn't done math in 2 years, so I had a huge wall to overcome. 

At this time, my work ethic fell into the Mariana Trench. I eventually switched my major to a "Bachelor of University Studies," which is essentially two minors mashed together. I picked Japanese Language and Asian Studies, as I had already taken 2 years of Japanese. I filled out the rest of my requirements with the Film program. Later in life, I would take a certification course through San Joaquin Valley College, and get CompTIA A+ certifications, which I used to get into Slot Machine Repair and later Educational IT. However, casinos have terrible hours, and working in IT isn't exactly the most creative job. I don't particularly consider myself to be a creative person, but I think it's because I lack the skills to put what's in my mind into a product. So now I'm at Epicodus.

Through Epicodus, I hope to gain the skills to be a developer. For me, this means not only a way to earn a living (though I hear they make very nice livings), but also a way to express myself creatively. I hope to be able to create all sorts of applications, or have the skills to (fairly) easily learn languages I may need to complete that goal. Personally, that means various applications to make my life easier, such as an Armor Set Search for the Monster Hunter games, or an application to help my wife with her grading (she's a schoolteacher). Professionally, the little front-end development we've done so far is very fun, and I really enjoy it. The thought of having to actually DESIGN things is scary, but UX design has always been interesting to me. I'm looking forward to exploring career services more to find out what kinds of jobs/internships are available for someone with my skillset.

I would be lying if I didn't say my end goal was to make video games, though. I have tons of ideas, and even if I just make little things for myself, I'm hoping I can successfully get them out of my head.

>- Think about asking for help in the classroom. Are there times when it's easier or harder for you to ask for assistance from a peer? What about a teacher?
>- What factors make it harder to ask for help? Why do these stand in your way?
>- What can you do to minimize or eliminate these factors? In what ways could you practice sharing your problem solving process throughout the week?

I feel uneasy asking peers questions, because they're all so busy during class time, and I don't want to bother them after class. Teachers aren't particularly easy to ask questions to, due to the format of the class. I find it significantly easier to ask (and learn to be honest) in person. I think it would be helpful if teachers were in a Discord room, because otherwise they don't "feel" available. 

I end up googling and trying out a lot of things. This causes problems with my partners as I tend to take over the session too much when I get "into it." However, this is something I'm working on, and I think I did much better in the second half of the week than the first.

All of my research is going into making "cheatsheets," and hosting them on Github, which I hope are not only useful to myself, but also my classmates.

## Journal 3 2022/08/14

>You've undoubtedly experienced tricky bugs in your Epicodus journey so far. This is an unavoidable part of programming. Seriously. _Every_ developer–no matter how experienced–deals with bugs, setbacks, and other issues. We find students are most successful when they're able to turn these issues into learning opportunities.
>
>-   What is it about encountering a difficult task or bug that frustrates you? Do you have any behavior patterns that make solving these problems more difficult? _(For example, do you always feel pressured to finish projects quickly, making time setbacks involved in bugs stressful or upsetting? Does being uncertain how to solve a bug evoke feelings of not being 'good' or 'smart' enough?, etc.)_ List as many as applicable
>-   Conversely, is there anything about tricky bugs or issues you actually enjoy? _(It's okay if there isn't, but do you like hunting down the problem? The debugging process? The satisfaction of finally making it work?)_ Do you have any patterns of behavior that make solving problems easier or less stressful?
>-   Review the list of things you find frustrating. For each item, identify something you could try to lessen that frustration, and turn the situation into a productive educational experience. _(For instance, if the time setback is what stresses you most about bugs, could you plan on reminding yourself that Epicodus doesn't grade students on the amount of work they finish each day?)_
>-   Review the list of things you actually find enjoyable about tracking down bugs, if anything. Is there anything you could do to maximize this benefit or enjoyment? List your ideas.

I think the hard part about encountering difficult bugs is knowing where to start. Even if I use debugger, my initial code is usually quite messy, as I've been messing around and moving things about. I also tend to experiment maybe more than I should, and use functions and other features I don't know 100% how to use yet.

However, figuring out how to make something work is very fun. Squishing the bug feels good, especially once you fully fix it, though making small steps feels good as well. I tend to Google A LOT, and have pretty good Google-fu, though sometimes now knowin the "proper" names for things can make finding the answers I'm looking for difficult.

## Journal 4
>-   When, like all developers, you encounter a problem you can't immediately solve, what's your internal reaction? Is it along the lines of _"Oh, I'm not smart enough for this._", more like _"Okay, I just need to learn more."_, or something else?
>-  Be honest, what do you value and praise yourself for more? Innately/already knowing how to solve a problem? Or being able to stick with it, research, troubleshoot, and learn more to debug?
>-   Based on your answers to questions above, do you think you have a growth mindset? Why or why not?
>-   If you don't currently have a growth mindset, identify what you could do differently to begin fostering one. Or, if you already think you do, what could you to do maximize it?

## Journal 8
>-   What were your most notable _non-technical_ discoveries during this exercise? Whether about yourself, group communication, working with others, or something else?
>-   What were your greatest strengths? What about your biggest areas for improvement?
>- Identify what you can do in the next six sections to further develop any areas for improvement before the next group project.
>- Overall, what would you do differently next time? Is there a lesson to be learned and brought with you to your pairing or next group work experience?
